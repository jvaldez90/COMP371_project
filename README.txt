COMP 371 - Assignment 2
Student Name - Cristian Tesa

This assignment was build upon the assignment 1 and the lab framework provided to us.
The whole project was included to ensure that everything works on other machines.
To run it on Windows run the Labs.sln in the VS2017 folder.

The .cpp file can be found in the Source file.
All the textures are in the Assets/Textures folder.
All the shaders are in the Assets/Shaders folder.

All the functionalities were implemented exactly as stated in the assignment pdf, except:
	- To rotate the whole model left 5 degrees about y-axis, press 'q'
	- To rotate the whole model right 5 degrees about y-axis, press 'e'
	- To enable textures, press 'x'
	- To disable textures, press 'z'
	- To enable shadows, press 'b'
	- To disable shadows, press 'v'
	- The 1st joint rotates only over z-axis since this is how an arm would rotate in real life,
		to rotate it, press '1' and '2' to rotate it in the opposite direction
	- To rotate the 2nd joint over x-axis, press '3' and '4' to rotate it in the opposite direction
	- To rotate the 2nd joint over y-axis, press '5' and '6' to rotate it in the opposite direction
	- To rotate the 2nd joint over z-axis, press '7' and '8' to rotate it in the opposite direction


Also, note that to activate any of the inputs from the keyboard lowercase characters should be used.
